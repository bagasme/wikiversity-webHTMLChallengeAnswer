From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker" alt="Wikipedia"> Wikipedia</a> : <br/>
    <p>
The Nutcracker (Russian: Щелкунчик, Балет-феерия / Shchelkunchik, Balet-feyeriya
 About this sound listen (help·info); French: Casse-Noisette, ballet-féerie) is
 a two-act ballet, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov 
 with a score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (op. 71). The libretto is adapted from 
 E. T. A. Hoffmann's story "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King", by way of Alexandre
 Dumas' adapted story "The Nutcracker". It was given its premiere at the Mariinsky
 Theatre in Saint Petersburg on Sunday, 18 December 1892, on a double-bill with
 Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta.[1]

Although the original production was not a success, the 20-minute suite that
 Tchaikovsky extracted from the ballet was. However, the complete Nutcracker has
 enjoyed enormous popularity since the late 1960s and is now performed by countless
 ballet companies, primarily during the Christmas season, especially in North America.[2]
 Major American ballet companies generate around 40% of their annual ticket revenues
 from performances of The Nutcracker.[3][4]
    </p>

    <p>
Tchaikovsky's score has become one of his most famous compositions, in particular the
 pieces featured in the suite.[5] Among other things, the score is noted for its
 use of the celesta, an instrument that the composer had already employed in his much
 lesser known symphonic ballad The Voyevoda.
